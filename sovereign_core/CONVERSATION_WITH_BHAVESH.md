# Conversation Simulation: Presenting Sovereign Core to Bhavesh

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Participants:** Soham Kotkar (You) & Bhavesh (LM Core Team)  
**Purpose:** Integration planning for Sovereign LM Bridge + Multilingual KSML Core

---

## 🎯 **Opening & Context Setting**

### **Soham:**
> "Hi Bhavesh! I've completed the technical implementation of the Sovereign LM Bridge + Multilingual KSML Core system. As per the coordination table, I need to integrate with your LM Core API to complete the end-to-end pipeline. 

> The system is designed to take your LM responses, add KSML semantic alignment (intent classification, karma state detection, Sanskrit root tagging), process RL feedback, and prepare speech-ready text for Vaani TTS. 

> I'm ready to integrate with your `/compose.final_text` API - I just need some details from you to complete the connection."

### **Bhavesh:**
> "Great! I'm excited to see what you've built. I have the `/compose.final_text` endpoint ready. What specific information do you need from me?"

---

## 📋 **Technical Requirements Discussion**

### **Soham:**
> "Perfect! Let me show you what I've built and what I need from you. 

> **First, let me show you how we're integrating with your API:**"

*[Shows `sovereign_core/bridge/reasoner.py` - lines 15-16 and 204-230]*

```python
# Current configuration
self.bhavesh_lm_endpoint = "http://localhost:8000/compose.final_text"

async def _get_lm_response(self, text: str, user_id: Optional[str], session_id: Optional[str]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get LM response from Bhavesh's system"""
    # This is where we'll make the actual HTTP call to your API
    # Currently simulated, but ready for real integration
```

> "As you can see, I have the integration point ready. I need to know:

> **1. What's your actual API endpoint URL?**  
> **2. What authentication method do you use?**  
> **3. What's the request format you expect?**  
> **4. What's the response format you return?**"

### **Bhavesh:**
> "Excellent! Here are the details:

> **API Endpoint:** `https://api.bhavesh-lm.com/v1/compose/final_text`  
> **Authentication:** Bearer token in Authorization header  
> **Request Format:**
```json
{
  "text": "User input text",

    Unified endpoint that connects Bhavesh's LM responses, refines them via RL-based 
    language alignment, and streams KSML-tagged results + speech-ready text to Vaani.
    """
    # Step 1: Get LM response from Bhavesh's system
    lm_response = await self._get_lm_response(text, user_id, session_id)
    
    # Step 2: Apply KSML semantic alignment
    ksml_result = await self.ksml_aligner.align_text(
        text=lm_response["generated_text"],  # Your generated text
        source_lang=lm_response["metadata"]["language_detected"],
        target_lang="en"
    )
    
    # Step 3: Process RL feedback
    # Step 4: Compose speech-ready text for Vaani
    # Step 5: Return unified result
