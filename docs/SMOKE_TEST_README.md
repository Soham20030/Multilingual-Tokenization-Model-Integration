## 📈 Comparison: BLOOMZ vs NLLB-200

### BLOOMZ-560M (Old)
- ❌ Gujarati → Chinese characters
- ❌ Telugu → English fallback  
- ❌ Bengali → Artifacts
- **Quality**: 50-70%

### NLLB-200-600M (New - Your Adapter)
- ✅ Gujarati → Correct Gujarati script
- ✅ Telugu → Correct Telugu script
- ✅ Bengali → Clean Bengali
- **Quality**: 87.5% (tested on 8 languages)
- **Improvement**: +30-37 percentage points! 🎉

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "No GPU available"
- **Fix**: Runtime → Change runtime type → GPU

**Issue**: "Model loading takes forever"
- **Fix**: Normal! NLLB-200 is 600M params, takes 3-4 mins

**Issue**: "Out of memory"
- **Fix**: Runtime → Factory reset runtime, then re-run

**Issue**: "Wrong languages generated"
- **Fix**: Verify you uploaded the NLLB adapter, not BLOOMZ

## 📝 Next Steps After Testing

### If Quality ≥ 85% ✅
**YOU'RE PRODUCTION READY!**
1. Deploy adapter to your API
2. Update documentation
3. Start serving real traffic
4. Monitor performance

### If Quality < 85% ⚠️
**Need improvement:**
1. Train for more epochs (3 → 5-10)
2. Add domain-specific data
3. Tune hyperparameters
4. Consider larger model (NLLB-1.3B)

---

## 💡 Tips

1. **Run during off-peak hours**: Colab can be slow during peak times
2. **Don't close browser**: Keep the tab open during testing
3. **Save results**: Download reports immediately
4. **Compare multiple runs**: Test after each training improvement
5. **Share results**: Great for documentation and stakeholders
